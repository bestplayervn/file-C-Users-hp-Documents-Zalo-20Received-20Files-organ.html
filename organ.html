    <h1>Human Anatomy</h1>
    <h2>Major Organs and their Functions</h2>
    <section>
        <h2>The Heart and Lungs</h2>
        <p>The heart, located within the chest cavity, is cone-shaped and has four chambers: two upper atria and two lower ventricles.</p>
        <p>Coronary arteries and veins nourish the heart muscle. Valves ensure blood flows in one direction only, between atria and ventricles, and ventricles and arteries.</p>
        <p>Surrounding the lungs are two pleural membranes. The outer layer (parietal pleura) sticks to the chest wall, and the inner layer (visceral pleura) covers the lungs. Between them is a thin layer of fluid that allows the lungs to expand.</p>
        <p>Lungs contain millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli, providing a large surface area for gas exchange between inhaled air and blood.</p>

        <h2>The Digestive System</h2>
        <h3>Stomach</h3>
        <p>The stomach is a pouch-like organ that stores and breaks down food. It has four main layers: a muscular outer layer, a submucosa layer, and a mucosa layer containing gastric glands that produce digestive juices.</p>
        <h3>Small Intestine</h3>
        <p>The small intestine is a long, narrow tube responsible for absorbing nutrients from food. It also has four layers similar to the stomach and contains villi, finger-like projections that increase the surface area for absorption.</p>
        <h3>Large Intestine</h3>        
        <p>The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from digested food waste and forms feces for elimination.</p>

        <h2>Other Organs</h2>
        <h3>Liver</h3>
        <p>The liver, with four lobes, is responsible for various functions like filtering blood, producing bile, and storing nutrients.</p>
        <h3>Uterus (Female Reproductive System)</h3>
        <p>The uterus is a pear-shaped organ in females involved in menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth.</p>
        <h3>Kidneys</h3>
        <p>Each person has two kidneys, which filter waste products from the blood, maintain fluid balance, and regulate blood pressure.</p>
        <h3>Brain</h3>
        <p>The brain, the body's control center, is divided into three main parts: cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum. It is composed of neurons and glial cells and is responsible for various functions like thought, movement, and sensation.</p>
